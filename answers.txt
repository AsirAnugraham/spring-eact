1)What is Virtual DOM?
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. 
-This process is called reconciliation.

2)What is React Lifecycle ?
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

-Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

*constructor()
*getDerivedStateFromProps()
*render()
*componentDidMount()

-The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.

A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

*getDerivedStateFromProps()
*shouldComponentUpdate()
*render()
*getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
*componentDidUpdate()

-The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.

React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:

*componentWillUnmount()

3)What are hooks and their type?

-Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. 
-Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

-Basic Hooks

*useState
*useEffect
*useContext

-Additional Hooks

*useReducer
*useCallback
*useMemo
*useRef
*useImperativeHandle
*useLayoutEffect
*useDebugValue

4) What is prop in react ?
Props are arguments passed into React components.

Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

props stands for properties

*Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. 
-But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. 

5. What is React? 
React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. 
-The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. 
-It works only on user interfaces in the application. 
-This corresponds to the view in the MVC template.
